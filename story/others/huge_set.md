title: Huge set

There can be **a lot** of links on a wikipedia page.

{% include huge_set.html %}

<div class="alert-success" markdown="1">
The plot isn't pretty because the x axis is not logarithmic but it emphasizes the fact there can be a lot of links up to.
</div>

A [fast player]({{ '/story/2_c' | relative_url }}) might click on the first "good" link he finds because remembering all the links and choosing the best one might be tedious. 

Because you have to scroll down to see more links, the position of the links thus matters for the [navigation]({{ '/story/2_a' | relative_url }}). 

Our "[lazy]({{ '/story/2_b' | relative_url }})" players might be good ;)
