> *"Abondance is a semi-hard, fragrant, raw-milk cheese made in the Haute-Savoie department of France. Its name comes from a small commune also called Abondance. A round of Abondance weighs approximately 10 kg (22 lb), and its aroma is comparable to Beaufort, another French cheese variety. Abondance is made exclusively from milk produced by the Abondance, montbéliarde, and tarine breeds of cattle. The proportion of the Abondance breed within the herd of cattle that produces the milk must be a minimum of 55 percent.[1] In 1998, 873 tonnes were produced (+16.4 percent since 1996), 34 percent from local farms."*
