This article is **the** biggest hub of wikispeedia and comes up at every step of our analysis: in the top 10 Hubs, in the top 10 3 Authorities, most clicked article, most linked out, second mst linked in...

So we had to give it its own page on our own wikispeedia game.

We don't want you to miss any of the story so to avoid any shortcut, this page does *not* lead you to another one. If you are here, just go back :).

Or if you are actually interested in the actual page:

<iframe
  src="{{ /assets/embeddings/United_States.html | relative_url }}"
  style="width: 100%; height: 80vh; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
