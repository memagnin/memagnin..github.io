We explored three dimensions of Wikispeedia navigation: the structure of Wikipedia’s link graph, how players navigate it, and how graph size and restrictions affect success.

- At the structural level, Wikipedia articles concentrate links in predictable places, with many appearing early in the lead and another cluster near the end. Link positions follow a highly skewed distribution. Severe link restrictions make navigation nearly impossible, yet the lead section alone preserves much of the graph’s connectivity because many deeper links are duplicated there. The network is hierarchical, with geographic articles acting as major authorities and list-like pages serving as hubs. Full navigability ultimately requires access to many links per article, highlighting the strong redundancy built into Wikipedia.

- Player behavior closely reflects this structure. Articles with many incoming links attract far more clicks, and the most visited pages align with top graph authorities. Players follow a consistent navigation pattern, first moving through highly connected hubs and then narrowing toward more specific articles near the target. They strongly prefer early-positioned links, even though they still click throughout articles. Most successful paths rely on only a limited subset of early links, indicating that deep exploration is rare.

- The analysis of different subgraph constructions relies on paths generated by a pretrained model that approximates human navigation behavior. While the model captures key player tendencies, results should be interpreted comparatively. Smaller graphs produce shorter paths but sharply lower completion rates, while larger graphs provide redundancy and alternative routes that substantially improve success. Strong link restrictions remove critical shortcuts, leading to fast but largely unsuccessful navigation and showing that there is no better smaller graph.

Here is the graph of the game!
