Careful! Lazy does not mean slow!

We have seen that even if we have a couple of top links at our disposal, we can finish a lot of paths and pretty quickly. 

Firstly, Wikispeedia is a game where beeing fast is important, in that sense it makes sense to be lazy and not bother scrolling down. Most links will be repeated anyway.

Secondly, if you have a huge set (with repetition) of links to choose from, it will be much harder to decide on which link to click on and you will thus be slower...

Let's see if players actually tend to click only on the first articles. 

<div class="alert-danger">
The next plot shows the (smoothed) amount of clicks on each article compared to the relative position throughout the article. In red the density of the actual number of articles is shown. Here we restricted to the first appearence of each link, which means that if a link appeared twice on the same article we only considered the first one because the format of the data does not allow us to see which link is being clicked.    
</div>

<div class="alert-success">
As expected, most players tend to click on the links appearing at the top of articles, which coincides with their distribution. However, many hyperlinks appear at the bottom of pages and they seem to be less considered by players.
</div>

For this, we can use a similar plot as in the previous section and see how many players paths are possible when only selecting the first n links.

<div class="alert-danger">
This plot shows the number of paths taken by players that only follow the first n hyperlinks, with n represented on the x-axis.
</div>

{% include player_path_length_distribution_plotly.html %}

<div class="alert-success">
As we can see, the proportion of each length seems to be stable for each choice of n.
</div>

TODO: Plot like 1.2 to see the number of paths that disappears

<div class="alert-success">
write here what we see in the plot
</div>
