Careful! Lazy does not mean slow!

We have seen that even if we have a couple of top links at our disposal, we can finish a lot of paths and pretty quickly. 

Firstly, Wikispeedia is a game where beeing fast is important, in that sense it makes sense to be lazy and not bother scrolling down. Most links will be repeated anyway.

Secondly, if you have a huge set (with repetition) of links to choose from, it will be much harder to decide on which link to click on and you will thus be slower...

Let's see if players actually tend to click only on the first articles. For this, we can use a similar plot as in the previous section and see how many players paths are possible when only selecting the first n links.

{% include player_path_length_distribution_plotly.html %}

We can see that ...

TODO: Plot like 1.2 to see the number of paths that disappears

write here what we see in the plot
