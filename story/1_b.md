title: Power of the first links
---

Let's see if the first links are highly connected by looking at how the path possibilities shrink when restricting the page to the top links.

{% include barplot_subgraph_feasibility_parallel_plotly.html %}

<div class="alert-success">
By only looking at the lead section we are still able to complete more than half of the paths while the lead contains less than a fifth of the links (cf previous section).
</div>

The lead section contains a lot of usful links. By looking solely at the lead section we have great chances to still be able to go to the goal article. This is beneficial as the lead is smaller and contains less links, we can make choices faster and not bother scrolling through the whole page.

We can go further and look at how important the first n-links are:

TODO: include Fabien's graphs *interactive* and its analysis
something like this:
it followss a square law so adding a few links creates a lot more possibilities but then les importance, this makes sense as the link have already appeared and bigger hubs already appeared at the beginning.

TODO transition to part 2 saying we now look at players behaviour!

[PART2]({{ '/story/2_b' | relative_url }})
