From clicking through a tiny encyclopedia to navigating the largest knowledge network ever built, how does the pathing changes? 

This project aims to study and characterize the impact of two important variables over the Wikispeedia players behavior : 
- the positions of the links in the articles
- the size of the Wikipedia version they are playing on. 

We believe, and will verify, that the positional [structure of Wikipedia]({{ '/story/1_a' | relative_url }}) did not move much over the year : links are still in the same locations, we have same ratio of hubs, of isolated articles… and the size of wikipedia instead grew a lot since the 2007 Wikispeedia dataset. 

By analyzing these two aspects, we want to understand how a player in 2025 would behave if Wikispeedia was played on the full modern Wikipedia. Our goal is to estimate how navigation strategies would adapt and what level of performance could be expected today. Come with us on this journey !

To better understand what it is like to play wikispeedia on a smaller graph, you have to find your way through our story by navigating the hyperlinks, just like a wikispeedia game!

The goal is to get to the conclusion page. The correct link to click on is about the next step in the analysis. You can either find it from the current analysis e.g "We saw that geography is an important topic" -> solution will be "geography".

**We suggest that you read each page entirely before clicking on the hyperlinks!**

  <summary markdown="span">There will be some hints :)</summary>
  - if you are on a page "fun fact", then you got out of the datastory
  - Some links get you out of this website, just head back!
</details>

You can also directly check the [solution]({{ '/story/solution' | relative_url }})
