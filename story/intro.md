From clicking through a tiny encyclopedia to navigating the largest knowledge network ever built, how does pathing change?

This project aims to study and characterize the impact of two important variables on Wikispeedia players’ behavior:
- the positions of links within articles
- the size of the Wikipedia version they are playing on. 

By analyzing these two aspects, we want to understand how player behavior adapts to different underlying [graph structures]({{ '/story/1_a' | relative_url }}), for example how a player might navigate the full 2025 Wikipedia, and how such behavior could generalize to other networks with similar properties. Our goal is to estimate how navigation strategies evolve and what level of performance could be expected today. Come with us on this journey!

To better understand what it is like to play Wikispeedia on a smaller graph, you have to find your way through our story by navigating the hyperlinks—just like in a Wikispeedia game!

The goal is to reach the conclusion page. The correct link to click on corresponds to the next step in the analysis. You can infer it from the current analysis; for example, if we state “We saw that geography is an important topic,” then the solution will be “geography.”

**We suggest that you read each page entirely before clicking on the hyperlinks!**

  <summary markdown="span">There will be some hints :)</summary>
  - if you are on a page "fun fact", then you got out of the datastory
  - some links get you out of this website, just head back!
</details>

You can also directly check the [solution]({{ '/story/solution' | relative_url }}).
