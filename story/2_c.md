It looks like players that manage to complete their game tend to player differently than players who don't. Let us try to analyse this a bit further.

We first want to quantify efficiency of players. Here we define the efficiency of a **finished** path $$P$$ as follows:

$$ \operatorname{Efficiency}(P) = \frac{\operatorname{length}(P)}{\text{Length of the shortest possible path between the same start and end points}}$$

So an efficiency of $$1$$ would mean that the palyer played perfectly. We can now have a look at the distribution of the efficiencies when we restrict ourselves to the first $$n$$ hyperlinks (again).

Note that in the following plot we only consider finished paths. The efficiencies are computed relative to the restriction of wikispeedia. This means that for each $$n$$ we only consider the finished paths only using hyperlinks up to the $$n$$-th position and the shortest possible paths are computed similarly.

Here we need to be a little bit careful with the interpretation. Indeed some players would have played perfectly if they were not allowed to click on every hyperlink.
