It looks like players that manage to complete their game tend to player differently than players who don't. Let us try to analyse this a bit further.

We first want to quantify efficiency of players. Here we define the efficiency of a **finished** path $$P$$ as follows:

$$ \operatorname{Efficiency}(P) = \frac{\operatorname{length}(P)}{\text{Length of the shortest possible path between the same start and end points}}$$

So an efficiency of $$1$$ would mean that the player played perfectly. We can now compare the efficiencies with the lengths of finished paths.
