Welcome to group TMFT's ada project page!

Our [data story](/story/Intro.md) focuses on the game Wikispeedia, which involves navigating from one Wikipedia article to another using only the links within the articles.
If you want to try the game yourself, you can find it here: [Wikispeedia](http://wikispeedia.org/).


How would a Wikispeedia player play on the 2025 version of Wikipedia?
